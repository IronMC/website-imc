        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>IronMC is the go-to for low-end server .jar files! We created IronMC because we know how it feels to have servers will lower-end resources and all of them are taken up. 
            That's why at IronMC, we make it so we optimize the total resources used. IronMC optimizes to your server resources and is the best fit for custom server .jar files. 
            It will only use a small amount of your servers total resources to dedicate more resources to plugins(IronMC supports plugins). IronMC makes it easier than ever to 
            keep all of your releases up-to-date and organized. Get notifications any time thereâ€™s a new release on our <a href="https://discord.gg/d8KJs9tEWg"> discord </a>and 
            track changes with ease.
